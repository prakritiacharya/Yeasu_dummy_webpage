            <h2>Walkie talkie definition</h2>
            <h4>A walkie-talkie is a portable, two-way radio communication device that allows
            users to communicate wirelessly over short distances. It consists of a handheld
            unit with a built-in microphone, speaker, and antenna, typically operated by
            pressing a push-to-talk button to transmit and releasing it to listen. 
            Walkie-talkies are commonly used in various industries, outdoor activities, 
            and emergency situations where instant communication is essential.</h4>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h4>The walkie-talkie's history dates back to the 1930s when
            Canadian inventor Donald Hings developed a portable radio
            signaling device for bush pilots. In 1940, Motorola created
            the first handheld two-way radio, which they called the
            "Handie-Talkie," for military use during World War II.
            These early devices were bulky and had limited range.</h4>

            <h4>After the war, walkie-talkies became more compact and affordable,
            leading to their adoption in various industries like construction,
            public safety, and security. In the 1960s, advancements in transistor 
            technology further miniaturized walkie-talkies, 
            making them more practical for personal and commercial use.</h4>

            <h4>Since then, walkie-talkies have evolved significantly, with
            improvements in range, battery life, and features like encryption 
            and text messaging. Today, they remain widely used in numerous applications,
            including outdoor recreation, event management, and emergency response.</h4>
